# Map672
Modules for the NMP Map672 Course. 

## My Learning Objectives
* To gain understanding of web design mechanics and realm of possible application of learned skills. Being new programming I first need to understand the mechanics of development and then the linkages between how I interface with the web and the ‘what, why and how’ it all comes together. 
* Harbor useful and employable skills applicable to modern web design, specific to mapping. As an outcome, I need to be capable of producing a product that is of value to someone willing to pay me. 
* Build upon web design skills and learned infrastructure from MAP672 to adjacent platforms and programming languages through self-studies. My basic knowledge of web programming informs me that the industry is vast, changes daily, and is interconnected. From MAP672, I expect to discover the links between more advanced skills, building outward and upward. 
* Create the beginnings to a professional grade portfolio. “Gotta start somewhere!”
