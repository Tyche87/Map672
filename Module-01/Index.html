    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    <p>As of writing this reaction I must exclude myself from literal citizenship among the community that is ‘Coder’ and consider only Cartographer and Critique, since I know no code. Figuratively though, I can relate to an having an attraction to ‘shiny and new’ tech as well as an overwhelming urge to immorally force fit causality to correlation among data sets, regardless of ever having produced useable code. In my daily life I am a Critique, skeptical of what lies on the surface and critical of my environment, as it exists around me. I am the youngest sibling therefore I spent my youth as a provocateur. What remains is my interest in continually proposing theoretical outcomes in conversation with loved ones rather than focusing on a workable resolution or accepting reality.

I could be looking too simply at the idea of priorities, when I say that “Know your audience” seems to be a fitting rule to map by. When I first learned that Google prioritizes search results by ad dollars, or targets browsing habits, I was shocked! To know that my primary source of useless facts and Weird-Al lyrics was controlling my uptake for information with out my knowledge just seemed overbearing and manipulative over my web freedom. As a critical mapmaker, I will be charged with interpreting non-graphic information for to all who wish to, or have rights to view. Like Google, I will potentially be given the power (like Jeremy Cramton states) to show or intentionally obscure attributes to inform decision makers.  That being said, maybe mapmakers can draw a social parallel to the Hippocratic Oath, in “First, map no harm”.

Lastly, I’d like to react to point number four of the Floating Sheep Manifesto. I like the idea of comparing architectural design theory and graphics to map design (maybe it’s all just design). I believe Walter Gropius’ form-follows-function take on design from the 1960’s Bauhaus movement can be of use in mapping. I would agree that there’s really something to a beautiful map, but foremost a map should pride itself in clearly representing its attributes. The best modern maps in my opinion provoke thought in an attractive manner without sacrificing it’s ability to communicate.
